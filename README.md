Further side notes

In devlopment, my goal was to use clean coding practices as learned from the book i was currently reading along side the coursework the book was, "clean code by robert c. martin". Although i hadn't finished the book some of the practices learnt from the book are present through my code such as the main focus of legibilty which would lead to scalability.
